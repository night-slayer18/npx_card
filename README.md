This is my personalised npx card which can be used to contact me. Will be adding some more functions to this in the future. Appreciating ```stars``` if you like the project and want to try this for your self.

How to run - just hit ðŸ‘‡

```

#### STEPS TO CREATE YOUR OWN
The article written by our friend <a href="https://github.com/jackboberg" target="_blank">@jackboberg</a>. I used the same for the reference to deploy the package. Write a <a href="https://studioelsa.se/blog/open-source-oss-npx-business-card/" target="_blank">Simple npx Business Card.</a>
Do check out <a href="https://github.com/anmol098"> @anmol098</a> for the original work. Do give a star for him too.

#### npm init

Start a new ```node``` project and name it whatever you want. You could choose to name it after the executable you want to expose. Itâ€™s not necessary but conventions are nice, and it makes your binary more ```npx``` friendly.

```
mkdir night-slayer18
cd night-slayer18
npm init -y
```

At first, letâ€™s get the necessary CLI working.

```
lvim index.js
```
Now add the necessary logic you want into the file

```
console.log("Content")
```

You can execute your new CLI like this:

```
node index
```

#### ship it

Thatâ€™s an entirely functional first release! You just need to modify your package.json to let npm know to link your executable and you are off:
```
{
   name: "your_package_name",
  // ...
  "bin": {
    "your_package_name": "./index.js
  },
  // ....
}
```
By default, ```npm``` will expose your binary using the same name as your package. You can configure this if itâ€™s not what you want, but it will make your executable harder to use with npx.

Share your new CLI with the world!
```
npm version patch
npm publish
```
Now anyone can leverage your new CLI using npx, without needing to install it locally:
```
npx $YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME
```
